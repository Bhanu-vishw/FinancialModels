# Monte Carlo Integration: Variance Reduction Techniques

## Overview

This project explores Monte Carlo integration techniques with a focus on variance reduction methods. Using a toy function, we analyze integrals analytically and computationally, comparing the performance of different techniques. Though the toy function is simple, these methods apply to complex financial problems like derivative pricing.
