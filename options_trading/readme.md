# Options Pricing and Analysis: Final Project

## Overview

This project is designed to implement and analyze various financial modeling techniques related to options pricing and risk management. It includes the Black-Scholes model, Monte Carlo simulations, and the Longstaff-Schwartz methodology. The project also covers delta and gamma hedging strategies and explores volatility arbitrage using real-world financial data. By completing this project, you will gain hands-on experience with theoretical concepts and their practical applications.
