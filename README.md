# FinancialModels

This repository contains a collection of financial modeling projects covered during my course study on Financial Modelling, including implementations of the Black-Scholes model, Longstaff-Schwartz algorithm, and volatility arbitrage strategies. It covers topics such as option pricing, delta and gamma hedging, and profit analysis using real-world data. Each project is supported by detailed analysis and reproducible workflows to provide insights into quantitative finance concepts.
